'''Predict the output of the code shown below. When you run the 
code, do you see what you expected? Why or why not?

list1 = [2, 6, 4]
list2 = [2, 6, 4]

print(list1 == list2)
'''

'''Answer:
I would expect it to print "True" so yes I see what I expected
because list1 == list2 is True.  The equality operator is based
on the values contained in the list, not their memory location.
